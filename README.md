This is a test project, please only use if explicitly told to do so.

Toolbar Tidy is a Visual Studio extension that provides a minimalistic user interface for Visual Studio. 

You can apply the simplified profile from the `Tools -> Tidy Toolbar` menu. Once applied using the menu option again will revert back to your previous profile.

Note: It doesn't hurt to backup your current profile from `Tools -> Import and Export Settings` before applying the simplified profile.
